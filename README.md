# [João Magalhães Bootstrap Scripts](http://joaomagalhaes.eu)

This set of scripts were created in order to simplify the deployment of the various projects that encompass the joamag infra-structure.

## Quick start

* Download the [Python Script](https://raw.github.com/hivesolutions/bootstrap/master/lib/bootstrap.py).
* Run the command `python bootstrap.py --download` inside the target repository directory to download and update the set of scripts.
* Run the command `python bootstrap.py --bootstrap` in order to bootstrap the system repositories.

The bootstrap operation may take a while depending on the current size of the repositories.
